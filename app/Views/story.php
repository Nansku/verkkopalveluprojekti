In the beginning of 2020 many people chose to stay home 
more than previous years, that of course caused them to
drink more coffee. After drinking the same coffee over and over
again it might start to taste a little dull or repetitive.
And there was no well known ways to start exploring the world
of coffee without leaving your home. 
</p>
<p>
Then one spring evening when a group of students were spending 
time together (Following the safety instructions of the time 
of course), they got into the topic of the lack of 
diversity in their daily coffee. After some time of discussing 
their personal coffee habits there was a realization of how
different their ways of drinking coffee were, and all of them
agreed that they wanted to diversify their daily life
with different coffees. And so, team Vieno's Coffee was
founded.
</p><p>
First obstacle was to get a website as a platform to sell the 
coffee. The group began their journey into building a shop 
for their needs, and oh boy was it glorious.
</p><p>
 After establishing 
the brand, all the team members had to do was to make an advertising
post on their personal social medias and customers began rolling
in. They all fell in love with the site and the convenience of
the idea of home brought coffee. All they had to do was browse 
Vieno's Coffee Shop and pick the coffee or even a coffee maker
that piqued their interest. 
</p><p>
With Vieno's coffee shop getting a lot of attention from the masses
and with team Vieno's unbeatable presence in social media,
things were looking swell. But the demand was too high to
keep the business within 8 small apartments. And so began the hunt 
for an actual coffee shop.
</p><p>
After weeks and weeks of relentlessly looking for a building 
to call home, one advert stood out from the rest. Old medical
facilities in Ylivieska were on sale for a very cheap price.
The team contacted the owner of the plot and went to check it.
It was perfect for the coffee shop, there was a lot of space for
a warehouse and a place to call a cafe. A contract was made
and the renovations began immediately.
</p><p>
After a few more 
weeks of selling products from cramped apartments, the new
headquarters were finally open and ready to serve customers.
</p><p>
That's where Vieno's Coffee Shop is at right now,
everyone is working hard tomake Vienos Coffee Shop a 
global phenomenom that it undoubtedly will be.
